# shellfish-canvas

Render the Shellfish dashboard canvas.

Quick start

- Load dashboard HTML from your Shellfish repo (skills/shellfish/canvas/dashboard.html)
- Render via your canvas tool with live data once wired

Notes

- The current dashboard HTML is static (mock data) until wired to memory/*.json.
- Use this skill to standardize where the Shellfish UI lives for Clawdbot.
